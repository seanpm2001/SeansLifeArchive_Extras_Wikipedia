[https://github.com/seanpm2001/SNU_2D_ProgrammingTools_IDE_MediaWiki SNU 2D / Programming Tools / IDE / MediaWiki] - Future use planned

[https://github.com/seanpm2001/SeansLifeArchive_Extras_Wikipedia Seans Life Archive / Extras / Wikipedia] - Future use planned

== Page Status ==

I am receiving automated messages telling me I am abusing the system, I give it extra reason why I shouldn't put this on the Wikiproject yet. So I will just publish the source code separately for now.
