== Fun facts ==

Sean likes to be talked about in the past tense.

I love portmanteaus and acronyms.

Lorem Ipsum.

== Page Status ==

Wiktionary is telling me that if I don't make a contribution within 7 days, my page on Wiktionary will be "swiftly deleted" and I don't want to risk that. Alongside tons of automated messages telling me I am abusing the system, I give it extra reason why I shouldn't put this on the Wikiproject yet. So I will just publish the source code separately for now.
