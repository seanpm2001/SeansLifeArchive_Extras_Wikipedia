# Page Status

As of 2022, Saturday, January 22nd, Wiktionary is telling me that if I don't make a contribution within 7 days, my page on Wiktionary will be "swiftly deleted" and I don't want to risk that. Alongside tons of automated messages telling me I am abusing the system, I give it extra reason why I shouldn't put this on the Wikiproject yet. So I will just publish the source code separately for now.
