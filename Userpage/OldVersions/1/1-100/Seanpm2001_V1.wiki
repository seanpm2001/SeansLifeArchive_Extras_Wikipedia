Wikipedia is one of my top sites. I had an account here in the past, but it was used when I was inexperienced with Wikipedia's guidelines. I hope to be a better contributor now. I likely won't contribute too much here for now.

I am not active on Wikipedia as a signed-in user. You can reach out to me on GitHub if needed: https://github.com/seanpm2001/

== Interests ==
I have strong interests in computer science, and history. I also have interests in hundreds of topics, including typography, linguistics, mathematics, robotics, geography, skeuomorphism, and more.

== WikiPDF ==
I have an offline copy of Wikipedia articles I visit as a curated archive of my Wikipedia viewing history. It is a strange habit, but it is useful. I use it when I want to read offline, or don't want to open a web browser.
