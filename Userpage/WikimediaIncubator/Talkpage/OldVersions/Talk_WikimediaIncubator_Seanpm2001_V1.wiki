* You can select your interface language in [[Special:Preferences|your preferences]].
* If you make articles, templates or categories, don't forget to add a [[Help:FAQ#Prefix|prefix]]!
* If your knowledge of English is good, you can [[Incubator:Translation project|help with translating]] pages to other languages you know, so more people can understand them!
* If you want to translate the interface, please go to [[translatewiki:|Translatewiki.net]] and follow their instructions.
