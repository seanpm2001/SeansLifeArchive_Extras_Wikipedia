This is my WikiSource userpage for the user Seanpm2001. For my main page, go here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Seanpm2001

== Usage of WikiSource ==

I use WikiSource from time to time to read old books. I hope to also use WikiSource for other uses in the future.

== Data dream ==

One of my dreams is that one day (hopefully in my lifetime) all knowledge will be free, without crippling handicaps such as copyright, "intellectual" property, patents, DRM/TPM, trademarks, and other legal rubbish.

== Page Status ==

I am receiving automated messages telling me I am abusing the system, I give it extra reason why I shouldn't put this on the Wikiproject yet. So I will just publish the source code separately for now.
