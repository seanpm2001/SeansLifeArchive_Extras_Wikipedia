# SeanWallaWalla

This is a historical archive of the original SeanWallaWalla Wikipedia page, back when I was unaware of the rules of Wikipedia. It reflects my time on YouTube, and is considered an advertisement to Wikipedia [see: Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not:Advertising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:What_Wikipedia_is_not#ADVERTISING), and was rightfully removed, although I feel like it was more of a blog than an advertisement, both of which aren't what Wikipedia is for. I am just archiving the source code here.

The page was blanked. Please do NOT attempt to bring it back on Wikipedia. I re-uploaded it here, so that those who care about it can see it in its entirety, without making Wikipedia a slightly worse place.
